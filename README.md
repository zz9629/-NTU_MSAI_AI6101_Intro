- Reinforcement Learning Assignment: In this project, you will learn how to implement one of the Reinforcement Learning algorithms (e.g., Q- learning, SARSA, or value iteration, policy iteration) to solve the BoxPushing grid-world game with various difficulty levels. Novel RL ideas are welcome and will receive bonus credit. In this assignment, you need to implement the code on your own and present a convincing presentation to demonstrate the implemented algorithm.

- Take-home Essay: Moral philosophy is traditionally subdivided into metaethics, normative theory and applied ethics. What are the possible ethical standards that we find described in normative theory and how might they provide guidance on the AI research front?
